# Meeting 1

1. Search engine for URI for every building
2. Convince cities to generate a catalog for their data with tutorial
3. Make a combined overview of all the data for the 13 cities
4. Map everything from Aalst to LD
5. Demostrator of the data, see wednesday (people from ToeVla will come by)

WHICH INFORMATION/DATA IS THE MOST USED?? SCOPE: which type of buildings?

ToeVla + OnWheels data
OnWheels give an overview based on your given profile if building are accessible (voluntary)
No data atm gathered from cities theirself.

Find the gap between ToeVla, OnWheels, ...  for the cities with Linked Data
Everyone stays decentralized but connected with LD

Recommendations for cities how to publish it better

ToeVla: how to present all the measurements of a building? How can we map a whole traject for a user? 

EXPECTATIONS:

1. Support LD open data for cities with visualization (to convince them)
2. Use building data
3. Where do I need to go for my new ID? Is the building accessible?

SmartFlanders: Show the power of LD, metadata adding to the building
OASIS: Do something with our LD: map with accessible buildings

This public service has these kind of opening hours for example
AALST = nice to have
Tutorial for other cities to get the same level as Aalst

THURSDAY: Plan what we will do for each team (expectations + kanban)

ANTWERP will bring up data on accessibility as well
ASK NOW for more data while they aren't on holiday
